    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p>It’s very interesting that women were not recognized as being capable of working with computers until recently. Additionally, I would assume that women would be more encouraged to do computer art, since art has always seemed so feminine, emotional, and vulnerable. I thought it was really interesting that Vera Molnar mentioned the “science of art” and how computers and computer generated art was changing the course of art history. However, like she said, the repetition of images and symbols is nothing new. 
    At least according to the Journal, women have had a much bigger role in the expansion of computer art than I would have expected. Knowing that jobs involving coding and computers have always been male dominated, it was surprising to learn how much of an impact women have had. 

Questions: In what ways are digital and traditional art similar visually?
How does switching from traditional to digital art change the artist’s workflow and process? 
What are the most effective ways to present digital art? Is it on a screen, projected on a wall, or printed?</p>
    <p>I thought the reading was interesting. While reading, I couldn't really see the words, and inverted my colors to be able to have a white background. Which, in hindsight, completely ruins the point of having the background black. I never would have thought that the transition from black computer screens to white would have anything to do with race. I also really enjoyed learning about GUIs because I had never heard of them before.
I think this article was a cool example of writing that incorporated technology and taught that but also compared it to modern philosophical issues and race theory. I honestly never would have thought to put the two together. Because it included debatable topics and not just tech terms, it also made it easier to read and more interesting.
How does Silicon Valley compare now to the 70s?
Is there really a deeper meaning behind the switch from a black screen to a white screen in the 70s?
Will technology development shift away from the white male archetype soon?</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed reading the “How to Internet” article and want to focus on that. I don’t really remember a time before the Internet, as Facebook was becoming a thing when I was about ten, so I found the article super interesting. I think the internet is very intuitive for my generation and found it kind of funny how they used to make videos on how to actually use it. When the author was talking about sites where you could send random photos to people around the world I thought that was really cool and sort of similar to the new app BeReal that has been trending recently. I also thought the exhibit between people in LA and NYC looked cool. It was reminiscent of a time that I grew up in where you couldn’t just DM a friend from across the world on Instagram and you didn’t get to see regular people on the internet. I liked the author’s style and videos they included in the article quite a bit as well. 
Will we as a society ever get to go back to the pure exploration and fun of the internet when it was started? 
Do you think there will ever be a “new” internet? 
Why did we get rid of Microsoft Bob??? (that was so cute!!)</p>
    <p>Lauren McCarthy explores the complex relationship between humans, technology, and surveillance in “Feeling at Home.” The way she talked about being followed or watched made me think of how there are different types of surveillance. On social media, we are able to follow people we choose and share carefully curated posts. However, with home surveillance, nothing is filtered and it is much more voyeuristic. In the beginning of her talk, she addressed the name, “Feeling at Home,” and how she wanted the topic to feel comfortable. I think her humor and the way she brought up the topics was light and comforting, especially since surveillance and internet surveillance can be really scary. 

If individuals can gain access to surveillance video and information, just how much information does the government have on us? 
Is there really anything we can do to keep from being tracked? 
What laws may be most beneficial to humans’ information protection in the future?</p>
    <p>The way the author described poor image at first was very confusing. I associated “poor” with “bad” in my head right away, so when they started explaining that “poor image” comes from media that is more accessible to everyday people who aren’t in these high film societies, it seemed contradictory. I also learned a lot from this reading passage. As someone who doesn’t know a whole lot about film and the culture and history behind it, I had no idea that there were archives of films and that some things had never been put on digital. It’s really interesting and sad that a lot of films may be lost forever because there is no way of showing them anymore. However, I do think the idea of “poor image” is an example of how we have progressed as a media obsessed society. 

Will society ever revert back to days before poor image when there eventually becomes an overwhelming amount of meaningless media? 

Are poor images inherently good? Or bad? 

Does the presence of poor image mean society is going to have less and less masterpieces?</p>
    <p>I honestly never thought code could have bias. I was always under the impression that algorithms were the most fair way of doing things because humans had more bias. Additionally, after watching the video the first thing that I thought of was how filters on snapchat and tiktok work. A lot of them only work on certain people, or look really bad on a majority of people because they weren’t designed for their face shape or skin tone. I feel like social media filters are a micro version of the bigger issue the speaker was talking about. Obviously police using inaccurate or biased facial recognition software is more directly terrible and harmful, but the bias of filters affects so many people, especially young girls. 

Is there a political reason for coding bias beyond the fact that test sets aren’t diverse?
Are there examples of unbiased robots?
What should tch businesses do to ensure the unbiasedness of their robots?</p>
    <p>I really liked the TED talk about the single story. It’s something I knew was real from my own reading experience but I’ve never sat down and thought about it. It was valuable to hear from an African perspective especially because I think that is a continent where Americans and Europeans tend to group into one big socioeconomic class and group of people. 

For the Olivia Ross article, I think I was immediately really opposed to everything she was talking about. It is one thing to be conscious about your work and your art, but I think being hyper conscious about everything within the process of creating is so limiting and overwhelming and something I do not agree with at all. 

What are less overwhelming ways we can be conscious about creating art in the digital sphere?
Whose responsibility is it to tell more stories that break away from the single story? 
And what are ways society should encourage that?</p>
    <p>I really liked how Ari Melenciano stressed that design should be collaborative. I think working with other people and constantly talking out your ideas can be very beneficial and lead to a lot of cool ideas. I also thought her focus on nature in her designs was a good reminder that design and art doesn't have to be centered around humanity. I feel like design in particular has become very corporate and almost always has an underlying purpose. I appreciated how she didn't need to have a deeper meaning within some of her projects but still used her work as a form of activism.
1. how do visual aids that are used for activism purposes different from other mediums?
2. what are ways consumers can encourage a shift away from Western centric designs?
3. if as an artist you label yourself as an activist, can you ever create work that isn't inherently bound up in activism?</p>
    <p>I thought the TedTalk was really interesting. I’ve read a lot about how people who can’t hear can enjoy music through vibrations, so I wasn’t expecting the relation between ASL itself and music. I think it is very music to watch and also very similar to dance. Every movement has a meaning the same way ballet was created where each movement had a specific meaning. I think her bringing up “sound etiquette” was also very interesting. Sound is something I am consciously very careful of and sensitive to, but I also recognize that I can hear when something sounds uncomfortable or is too loud and stop. I never thought about what it could be like for someone who can’t hear to have to monitor the sounds they are making. 
Are some languages naturally more musical than others? 
What are other ways non-hearing people experience music? 
Do other sign languages “sound” different when we look at them?</p>
