    <div class="text_big"> Growing up, I was told that being thrown, hit, having my legs tied together, scratched, held by my ankles, having things thrown at me, punched, shoved, forced into stretches, yelled at until I cried, having tacks taped to my heels, not being allowed to talk without punishment, forbidden from coming to practice without shaving my legs, not being allowed to have romantic partners, and forced to continue practicing with injuries was normal. </div>

        Gymnasts deserve a safe facility surrounded by non-abusive staff and a supportive environment.
